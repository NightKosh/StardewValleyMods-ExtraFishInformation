# Extra Fish Information [1.0.0]

This mod adds extra info to the descriptions for each fish, which will help you find the fish you're hoping to catch!

As the extra info is added to the descriptions, *you will only be able to see information for fish that you have already caught*.

## Features
- For fish that can be caught using the **fishing rod**, the locations, seasons and times when the fish is active are added to the description (note that the 'Temp' and 'FishingGame' locations are ignored).
- For fish that can be caught in **crab pots**, the type of water that the fish is found in is added to the description.
